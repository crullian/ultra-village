    <h2 className="center-text">Welcome to Ultra Village</h2>
    
    <p>Ultravillage is a guide to underground ambient and new age releases from the 1970â€™s and 1980s with a primary focus on American artists. The site may expand in the future to include artists from other musically fertile scenes in Germany, Australia, the UK and Japan.</p>

    <p>The long term goal of this site is to include album reviews and bios for every artist that fits the above description, except those who exclusively released their work on major labels or are already well documented in mainstream sources (So no Enya, no Windham Hill releases, no Clannad, etc.)</p>

    <p>If you are interested in writing for the site, please reach out to me at <a href="mailto:ultravillagers@gmail.com" target="_top">ultravillagers@gmail.com</a></p>
